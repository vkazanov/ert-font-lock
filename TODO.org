   more languages for test comment parsing

 - [X] more lang tests: php, shell, more?

 - [X] package name: ert-font-lock

 - [X] example file loading helper macro

 - [X] non-assertion comment line checking

 - [X] assertions in multiline comments

 - [X] use ert-set-test/make-ert-test for the macro
